## Package Information

hex/standards provides common interfaces and type declarations for mostly used
modules for applications. It enables using implementations of these definitions
without any tightly coupled dependency just by accessing them from a dependency
injection container.

Reminder: this package only contains interfaces for adaptation of 3rd party
libraries. so, interfaces for other components should be defined in their own
respective packages.

For further details such as requirements, license information and support guide,
please see [main hex repository](https://github.com/eser/hex).
