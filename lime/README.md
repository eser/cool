## ðŸ“– Documentation

The [documentation](https://coollime.deno.dev/docs/) is available on
[coollime.deno.dev](https://coollime.deno.dev/).

## ðŸš€ Getting started

Install [Deno CLI](https://deno.land/) version 1.35.0 or higher.

You can scaffold a new project by running the cool lime init script. To scaffold
a project run the following:

```sh
deno run -A -r https://coollime.deno.dev
```

Then navigate to the newly created project folder:

```
cd lime-demo
```

From within your project folder, start the development server using the
`deno task` command:

```
deno task start
```

Now open http://localhost:8000 in your browser to view the page. You make
changes to the project source code and see them reflected in your browser.

To deploy the project to the live internet, you can use
[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy):

1. Push your project to GitHub.
2. [Create a Deno Deploy project](https://dash.deno.com/new).
3. [Link](https://deno.com/deploy/docs/projects#enabling) the Deno Deploy
   project to the **`main.ts`** file in the root of the created repository.
4. The project will be deployed to a public $project.deno.dev subdomain.
