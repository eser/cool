# Intro

‚úñÔ∏è **hex** is an ecosystem delivering practices, philosophy and portability.

hex consists of a set of **component**s that are designed to be used together.
These sub-components enable developers to abstract their codes for better
portability between platforms. Encourages ones to write codes once in functional
approach, then run on mainstream environments such as cli, bot platforms,
cloud-function runtimes and web apis.

# üöÄ Jumpstart

Ensure that [Deno](https://deno.land/) 1.27 or higher is installed on your
system first.

**Alternative I**:

Install hex cli globally first, then create a new project:

```sh
$ deno run -A https://hexfw.deno.dev

$ hex create my-project

Creating "hex framework web template 0.0.1" on my-project...
...
done.
```


**Alternative II**:

Without any preparation, invoke creating a new project remotely:

```sh
$ deno run -A https://hexfw.deno.dev create my-project

Creating "hex framework web template 0.0.1" on my-project...
...
done.
```


**Alternative III**:

Or run a hex routines directly from the resource:

```sh
$ deno run https://deno.land/x/hex/src/lib/functions/samples/basic.ts eser

{ payload: "hello eser" }
```
