# Intro

‚úñÔ∏è **cool** is an ecosystem delivering practices, philosophy and portability.

cool consists of a set of **component**s that are designed to be used together.
These sub-components enable developers to abstract their codes for better
portability between platforms. Encourages ones to write codes once in functional
approach, then run on mainstream environments such as cli, bot platforms,
cloud-function runtimes and web apis.

# üöÄ Jumpstart

Ensure that [Deno](https://deno.land/) 1.36 or higher is installed on your
system first.

**Alternative I**:

Install cool cli globally first, then create a new project:

```sh
$ deno run -A https://c00l.deno.dev

$ cool create my-cool-project

Creating "cool web project template 0.0.1" on my-cool-project...
...
done.
```

**Alternative II**:

Without any preparation, invoke creating a new project remotely:

```sh
$ deno run -A https://c00l.deno.dev create my-cool-project

Creating "cool web project template 0.0.1" on my-cool-project...
...
done.
```

**Alternative III**:

Or run a cool routines directly from the resource:

```sh
$ deno run https://deno.land/x/cool/hex/functions/samples/basic.ts eser

{ payload: "hello eser" }
```
