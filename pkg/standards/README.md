# ðŸ“‘ [@eser/standards](./)

`@eser/standards` provides common interfaces and type declarations for mostly
used modules for applications. It enables using implementations of these
definitions without any tightly coupled dependency just by accessing them from a
dependency injection container.

Reminder: this package only contains interfaces for the adaptation of 3rd party
libraries, so interfaces for other components should be defined in their own
respective packages.
