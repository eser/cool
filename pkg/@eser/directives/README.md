# ðŸ““ [@eser/directives](./)

`@eser/directives` consists of sets of rules and recommendations that can be
applied to the entire eserstack ecosystem. As Captain Picard of The USS
Enterprise would say, these directives are not just a set of rules, they point
to a philosophy that consists of some best practices and proven experiences.
